<p>Wonderful news, right? Wonderful news, right?</p>

<p>Well, not to same. Vaccinated people are up against new set of myths - they're literally magnetic or they're going to shed vaccine components and after the DNA of unvaccinated people. And despite th extra layer of protection, they still have to grapple with the same pandemic realities as everyone else</p>


<p>So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread COVID-19 to others? Infectious disease specialist <a href=""><span style="color:yellow;">Lyssette Cardona</span></a>, MD, answers those questions  and covers why vaccination is still one our best weapons in the fight against COVID-19.<br><br>

isn't the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there's still a chance that you could become infected.<br><br>
